# scoreboard-react
Scoreboard app built with React.js.  This app is a rewrite of a previous last-year app by using React 16. 
This is a simplest version of the React app setup that adds React and Babel scripts to index.html page.  Fastest setup for learning environment.  It is not optimial for production because it uses in-browser Babel trasnformer which is bad for performance.
